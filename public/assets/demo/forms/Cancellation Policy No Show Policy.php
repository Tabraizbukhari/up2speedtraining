<div align="justify"><h2>CANCELLATION POLICY/NO SHOW POLICY</h2><br /><br />
We understand that there are times when you must miss and appointment due to emergencies or obligations for work or family. However, when you do not call to cancel and appointment, you may be preventing another patient from getting much needed treatment. Conversely, the situation may arise where another patient fails to cancel and we ae unable to schedule you for a visit, due to a seemingly full appointment book. <br /><br />

<input type="checkbox" /> 1) I, the undersigned, have read and fully understand the above agreement.<br /><br />
By signing this form, I give permission to Up 2 Speed Sports Performance and Therapy to charge me for any future missed appointments or cancellation with no 24-hour notice. <br /><br />
